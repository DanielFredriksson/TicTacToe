# Abstract
This repository is my submission to the Tic Tac Toe Challenge.

# Usage
Navigate to root of project, then run the following in a terminal:
1. `npm i`
2. `npm run build`
3. `npm run start` or if you wish to alter the code while running, `npm run watch-node` and `npm run watch-ts` in two separate terminals.
4. Call http://localhost:3000/api/ according to endpoint specifications at [openapi.yaml](openapi.yaml)
5. Have fun, and if you come across anything funky, let me know @ daniel.ls.fredriksson@gmail.com
